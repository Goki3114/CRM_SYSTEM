**User Classes and Characteristics**
**Administrator**
Administrators are individuals within the organization who are tasked with the responsibility of configuring and managing the CRM system. Their roles include defining system settings, managing user accounts, and ensuring the overall system functionality. Administrators possess a high level of access and control to customize the CRM environment to meet organizational needs.

**Sales Representative**
Sales representatives are pivotal users actively engaged in the CRM system to facilitate lead management, opportunity tracking, and customer interactions. Their responsibilities involve utilizing the system to efficiently manage sales processes, monitor opportunities, and maintain an organized record of customer engagements.

Their role involves utilizing the system to access customer information, log interactions, and provide timely and effective support. Customer support users contribute significantly to maintaining positive customer relationships by utilizing the CRM tools to streamline communication and issue resolution processes.

**System User**
System users constitute a broader category encompassing all individuals who interact with the CRM system for various purposes. This user class may include individuals from different departments within the organization who utilize the CRM system to access customer information, generate reports, or perform specific tasks relevant to their roles. System users, while having varied responsibilities, collectively contribute to the utilization and success of the CRM system across the organization.

In summary, the delineation of user classes serves to highlight the diverse roles and responsibilities of individuals interacting with the CRM system, emphasizing the need for tailored functionalities to accommodate the distinct requirements of administrators, sales representatives, customer support personnel, and other system users within the organizational framework.

**Operating Environment**
**System Architecture**
The operating environment of the CRM system encompasses the underlying architecture and technical infrastructure on which the application relies for its proper functioning. The system is designed to be web-based, leveraging modern web technologies to provide a scalable and accessible platform for users. The architecture incorporates client-server principles, where the web browser serves as the client interacting with the server-side components of the CRM application.

**Web Browser Compatibility**
The CRM system is intended to be compatible with major web browsers, including but not limited to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. Ensuring compatibility with these widely used browsers is imperative to guarantee a consistent and optimal user experience across diverse computing environments. The web-based nature of the CRM system allows users to access the application seamlessly through their preferred browsers without sacrificing functionality or performance.

**Technical Dependencies**
The CRM system is built upon a specific set of technical dependencies, including a designated programming language and a chosen database management system (DBMS). The programming language serves as the foundation for the application's logic and functionality, while the DBMS is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing the data generated and processed within the CRM system. Adherence to these technical dependencies ensures uniformity in development practices and facilitates a cohesive integration of system components.

**Performance Considerations**
The operating environment is designed to meet performance requirements that dictate the system's responsiveness and scalability. The CRM system is engineered to support a minimum of 1000 concurrent users, with stringent response time constraints not exceeding 2 seconds. This emphasis on performance considerations underscores the commitment to delivering a robust and efficient CRM solution capable of accommodating the demands of a potentially large user base without compromising on speed or reliability.

In summary, the operating environment of the CRM system encompasses the architectural framework, browser compatibility, technical dependencies, and performance considerations. These elements collectively contribute to the system's reliability, accessibility, and efficiency, ensuring a seamless and high-quality user experience within the specified technical parameters.
