**2.4 Operating Environment**
**2.4.1 System Architecture**
The operating environment of the CRM system encompasses the underlying architecture and technical infrastructure on which the application relies for its proper functioning. The system is designed to be web-based, leveraging modern web technologies to provide a scalable and accessible platform for users. The architecture incorporates client-server principles, where the web browser serves as the client interacting with the server-side components of the CRM application.

**2.4.2 Web Browser Compatibility**
The CRM system is intended to be compatible with major web browsers, including but not limited to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. Ensuring compatibility with these widely used browsers is imperative to guarantee a consistent and optimal user experience across diverse computing environments. The web-based nature of the CRM system allows users to access the application seamlessly through their preferred browsers without sacrificing functionality or performance.

**2.4.3 Technical Dependencies**
The CRM system is built upon a specific set of technical dependencies, including a designated programming language and a chosen database management system (DBMS). The programming language serves as the foundation for the application's logic and functionality, while the DBMS is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing the data generated and processed within the CRM system. Adherence to these technical dependencies ensures uniformity in development practices and facilitates a cohesive integration of system components.

**2.4.4 Performance Considerations**
The operating environment is designed to meet performance requirements that dictate the system's responsiveness and scalability. The CRM system is engineered to support a minimum of 1000 concurrent users, with stringent response time constraints not exceeding 2 seconds. This emphasis on performance considerations underscores the commitment to delivering a robust and efficient CRM solution capable of accommodating the demands of a potentially large user base without compromising on speed or reliability.

In summary, the operating environment of the CRM system encompasses the architectural framework, browser compatibility, technical dependencies, and performance considerations. These elements collectively contribute to the system's reliability, accessibility, and efficiency, ensuring a seamless and high-quality user experience within the specified technical parameters.
